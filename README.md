# Fakenews-and-Deepfake-Analyzer
Project Overview- Description: VASTAVIK is a smart platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to instantly check if news articles, images, or videos are fake or real. Vastavik helps people easily spot fake news and deepfakes online by analyzing content and giving a trust score. Our platform aims to stop the spread of false information and help everyone make better decisions about what they believe online.
Problem Solution: In today's digital world, misinformation and deepfake content have become a significant threat, spreading rapidly across social media, news platforms, and the internet. Fake news manipulates public opinion, AI-generated deepfake videos are used for scams and blackmail, and misleading information threatens democracy by influencing elections and governance. As people lose trust in digital content, the need for an AI-powered verification system becomes crucial.for which VASTAVIK is designed to tackle this issue by providing real-time fact-checking and deepfake detection using AI and NLP technologies. It scans news articles, videos, and images for authenticity, assigns a trust rating to sources, and offers a browser extension for instant verification. By identifying manipulated media and false narratives, Vastavik helps protect individuals, organizations, and societies from misinformation. In an era where digital deception is on the rise, Vastavik serves as a reliable shield for truth, empowering users with accurate information and promoting media literacy.
